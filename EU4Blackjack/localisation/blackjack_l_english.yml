 blackjack.20.d: "Blackjack one of the most popular card games, and a staple at every casino. Played with a standard deck of cards, it is typically grouped in tables of games, with each player individually playing against the dealer.\n\nThe aim of the game is to get a total as close as possible to 21, without going above it. Cards have their standard playing card values, except: Jack, Queen, and King are all worth 10, and Ace is worth either 1 or 11, whichever would lead to a better total."
 blackjack.21.d: "Each game, or 'round' of Blackjack, is played as follows:\n - Each player makes a wager on that round\n - The dealer deals each players two cards face up, and themselves 1 card face up and another face down\n - Players take turns making a move, until all players are done playing\n - The dealer reveals his face down card, then deals himself\n - Players compare their hands individually to the dealer\n - Betting is resolved and money is either taken or paid out"
 blackjack.22.d: "On a players turn, the player can make the following moves:\n - Hit: ask the dealer to deal them another card, face up\n - Stand: stop drawing cards and confirm your total\n - Double Down: double your bet, hit exactly once more, and if your total remains 21 or lower, immediately stand\n - Surrender: halve your bet and forfeit the round\n\nOn the dealer's turn, they will hit if their total is 16 or under, and stand if their total is 17 or higher."
 blackjack.23.d: "Between each player and the dealer, the higher total (not exceeding 21) wins the round. There are a few special considerations:\n - A 'Blackjack' or 'Natural', a two-card total of 21 (10 value card + an ace) is an immediate win, regardless of the other's total. If a player wins on a Blackjack, their bet is paid out 3:2\n - A 'Bust' or a total above 21 is an immediate loss for the player, even if the dealer later goes on to bust themselves.\n - Surrendering is an immediate loss, even if the dealer goes on to bust or have a lower total than the surrendering player.\n - If the player and dealer both have blackjack, or both have the same non-blackjack total, the game is a "Push" and the player keeps their wager with no earnings."
 blackjack.24.d: "EU4 Blackjack has a few special rules\n - While 'Splitting' a pair is a standard rule in many casinos, EU4 Blackjack does not allow that move\n - There are no restrictions on when a player may double down\n - Players have a minimum bet of 5 ducats and a maximum bet of 5000 ducats\n - Players will automatically stand on a total of 21\n\nAlso note that, in a single-player game or a table with less than 4 players, AI countries will fill the remaning spots"
